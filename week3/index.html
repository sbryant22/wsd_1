					<h2>The Band</h2>
					<p class="rev_text">This five piece rock band from Orlando found a fresh way to incorporate melodic string arrangements with meaningful lyrics you'll find yourself singing for days after you hear them. As the guitar and drums take on their traditional roles in the band, the strings (Violin, Cello, and Upright Bass) provide the classical influence for a different twist on rock.</p>

			<h3 id="about">About the band</h3>
			<p>Cure for Caska has been played on numerous radio stations across the country (like WPRK, WMMO, and KJKT FM) and has had the opportunities to share the stage with famous bands such as Blues Traveler and The Spin Doctors at Hard Rock Live and House of Blues in Orlando, Florida.</p>
			<p>The band officially released their music video "Pleasantly Surprised" off of the album <em>Wait and Hope</em> on September 1, 2012. Their newest album <strong>Wait and Hope</strong> is now available on ITunes.</p>
			<p>Cure For Caska has proved themselves to be a talented group of skilled, soulful musicians that wear their heart on their sleeves. It's amazing how they can can turn even the most difficult situations into something so beautifully romanticized as a song, and perfect for the maturing audiences of today's indie-rock fan base. The album's 7 tracks are all as enjoyable to listen to as the next, and has left me wanting plenty more. - review by <a href="absolutepunk.net">absolutepunk.net</a></p>
